# Final Decision
We think that in terms of both utility and doability, our party app is the best idea. It's simple enough to give us a clear starting vision for what our end-goal is, while also leaving room for potential additions and reductions as we go. If we choose to do so, it would also have us learn new parts of Swift, such as how to access the system clock and use Notification Center.
