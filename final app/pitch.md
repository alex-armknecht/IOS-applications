# Pitch

## Inspiration Statement
Alex is a college student who needs a way to find parties because they want to have fun.

## Possible Solutions
* Activity finder/generator for lonely and boring nights
* Map/Party listing for partiers to find each other

## Chosen Idea
We decided to go with the party listing idea primarily because it began to collectively manifest in our heads as we were talking about it. We also immediately identified APIs and uses for Firebase that would fulfill the project requirements, and some challenges and new technologies that would be interesting to overcome and learn along the way.

* Map to find nearby parties / users
* Authentication allows to "register" active/planned parties
    * Requirements/What to bring for the party
    * Rules
    * Rating of host/party
* Notifications for starting times
* Reporting capabilities for weird / creepy users

## Human Story
Say it’s a Friday night. And you have no friends. Or maybe you have friends don’t know how to have fun. So you want to go to a party, but you don’t have any friends, or your friends don’t know where to find parties, just like you. That’s where our app comes in. Party Finder is a local party-finding app which helps people locate nearby gatherings that they like so that we can bring together party people.
