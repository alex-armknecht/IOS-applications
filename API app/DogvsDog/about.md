# Dog vs Dog
An app where the user votes on two random images of dogs and votes on which one they like more. The dog not chosen will be replaced with a different dog. Vote on the same dog more than once and grow your streak.

View preview with any iOS Device (looks best with iPhone12)

The API is titled, “The Dog API” and it provides a random image or gif of a dog. The JSON file includes the link to the image, and the image’s ID. Link to the API: https://thedogapi.com/
